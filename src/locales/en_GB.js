			"debrief": "Debrief",
			"debrief-text-1": "Native bees play a crucial role in ecosystems and agriculture, pollinating more than 80% of flowering plants and 75% of global food crops. Their contribution extends to over $1.5 billion in annual food production.",
			"debrief-text-2": "At the same time, estimating bee abundance and richness in agroecosystems is constrained by short sampling durations, typically lasting one hour or less, and limited site visits, typically between 10 to 20, rarely exceeding three sampling trips.",
			"debrief-text-3": "Speaking about business models within the current landscape of remote (honeybee hive) monitoring, they predominantly revolve around a singular stakeholder, namely the beekeeper. These models are largely centralized and typically hinge on either Hardware Sales and Installation or Subscription-based Services. However, beekeepers commonly exhibit hesitancy to invest in such systems and services, leading to limited market penetration. Consequently, even if the reliability of the collected data is guaranteed, its impact on conservation efforts remains constrained.",
			"debrief-text-4": "ReFi and the implementation of a fully decentralized network and marketplace, emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges. Enabling individuals to operate a node equipped with nesting site(s) infrastructure, and incentivizing their participation by contributing or selling generated datasets on a decentralized marketplace, creates a more inclusive model.",
			"offering": "Our offer",
			"offering-text-1": "We are introducing a groundbreaking decentralized network tailored for pollinator species management in agroecosystems. Our innovative system integrates IoT technology with advanced methodologies like Remote Sensing and Trap Nesting, powered by Machine Learning and AI. By focusing on pollinator recognition, stressor detection, and bee abundance estimation, we revolutionize traditional hive monitoring methods to prioritize pollination-specific metrics.",
			"offering-text-2": "With our platform, individuals can operate nodes equipped with nesting site infrastructure, fostering community engagement. Through a decentralized marketplace, users can contribute or sell data, promoting inclusivity and collaboration. Furthermore, the ability to develop and run applications on their nodes utilizing available datasets in the network elevates the potential for valuable insights, ensuring widespread participation and impact.",
			"projects": "Our projects",
			"projects-title": "We are dedicated to our efforts in supporting pollinators through a range of projects and activities.",
			"projects-wild-pollinators": "Wild pollinators",
			"projects-wild-pollinators-1": "A decentralized network of peer-to-peer monitoring nodes that employs AI and machine learning algorithms to detect and identify bees and pollinators, generating essential data for conservation efforts.",
			"projects-bumblebees": "Bumblebees",
			"projects-bumblebees-1": "Monitoring system enhancing measurability and exerting precise control over the pollination process facilitated by bumblebees in both greenhouse and crop field environments.",
			"projects-honeybees": "Honeybees",
			"projects-honeybees-1": "Monitoring system prioritizing pollination-specific parameters, including bee counts, mortality rates, identification of primary stressors, and nectar flow.",
			"pollinators-importance": "Importance of wild pollinators",
			"pollinators-importance-1": "While honeybees and bumblebees undeniably contribute significantly to agricultural pollination, it is crucial to recognize the indispensable role of wild pollinators in maintaining ecosystem health and biodiversity. Conservation efforts focused on protecting and promoting the habitats of wild pollinators are essential for ensuring the continued resilience of ecosystems worldwide. Recognizing and valuing the diverse contributions of wild pollinators is key to a sustainable and balanced approach to pollination in our ecosystems.",
